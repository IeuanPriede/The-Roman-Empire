An introduction into the deep history of the Roman Empire.

The Roman Empire profoundly shaped today's world, laying foundations in law, governance, architecture, and language that continue to influence modern societies. Their innovations in engineering and infrastructure—such as roads, aqueducts, and urban planning—paved the way for modern city development. Latin, the language of the Romans, evolved into the Romance languages and enriched English vocabulary. Additionally, Rome’s model of a republic and ideas on citizenship influenced modern democratic institutions. Through these legacies, the Roman Empire remains woven into the fabric of contemporary life.

## User Experience

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to use a darker red colour scheme to add emphasis to fact that this site is about the Roman Empire. A darker shade of red, or maroon, is synonymous with the Romans.

* In the header and footer I used #800000.
* In the main body of the page I used #491616.
* For the text I used #ffffff.
* For the background to the text I used #75030399.
* For the submit button "Subscribe" I used #ffd700.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Cormorant] ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant:ital,wght@0,300..700;1,300..700&display=swap')
* For the Page Content I have used the google font [Karla] ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Karla:ital,wght@0,200..800;1,200..800&display=swap')

### Imagery

As the website is called The Roman Empire, I wanted to use an image for the page background of a Roman structure (colosseum) to give the user the feeling that they are visiting an ancient Roman site. Link: [Colusseum](https://www.pexels.com/photo/colosseum-rome-851646/).

The map of the Roman territory was taken from google images. Here is the link: [Map of Roman territory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Map_of_the_Roman_Empire_at_its_height.svg/1200px-Map_of_the_Roman_Empire_at_its_height.svg.png).

The images of the Roman Soldier and the Chariot were taken from Pixabay. Here are the links: [Roman Soldier](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/05/28/09/59/rome-2350633_960_720.jpg), [Chariot](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/09/17/19/42/char-4484402_1280.jpg).
